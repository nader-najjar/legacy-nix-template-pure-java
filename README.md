Java best practices.

&nbsp;

## 1. Local Development Machine Prerequisites

* Install Nix as per <https://nix.dev/install-nix>
  * Nix handles all other requirements so that developer machine setup is as minimal as possible
    * Further, it does not matter what version of Nix you have - it guarantees reproducibility
  * If, after an Apple update, nix is not found on PATH, follow <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7880> and add the snippet to `~/.zshrc` instead

&nbsp;

## 2. Tips

* Run `echo "alias ub='./universal-build'" >> ~/.zshrc` then `source ~/.zshrc` to make `ub` a quick alias for `./universal-build`
* Add the Nix snippet to your `~/.zshrc` so it is never wiped by system updates (snippet: <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7880>)

&nbsp;

## 3. Main Build Tasks

### `./universal-build build`

* Compiles the code under `src`
* Runs unit tests
* Runs Jacoco
* Runs Checkstyle
* Runs SpotBugs
* Builds a container image with Podman, set to run the code entrypoint (tagged `<project-name>:latest`)
* Saves the image as `build/container-image.tar`

### `./universal-build clean`

* Removes build output directories

### `./universal-build help`

* Invokes Gradle's help command, showing basic functionality

### `./universal-build tasks`

* Invokes Gradle's tasks command, showing all available tasks

&nbsp;

## 4. Workflows

### Adding A Java Dependency

1) Find the coordinates on Maven Central (<https://central.sonatype.com>) or the library’s docs.
2) Add the dependency with an explicit version in the right scope:
   * `implementation("group:artifact:version")`
   * `compileOnly("group:artifact:version")`
   * `annotationProcessor("group:artifact:version")`
   * `runtimeOnly("group:artifact:version")`
   * Tests mirror these scopes: `testImplementation`, `testCompileOnly`, `testAnnotationProcessor`, `testRuntimeOnly`
3) Update the Gradle lockfile using the workflow below
4) Run `./universal-build build` to download and verify it resolves; use an IDE “reload Gradle project” if needed.

### Updating Gradle Lockfile

1) Run `./universal-build dependencies --write-locks`

### Adding A Toolchain Dependency

1) Search <https://search.nixos.org/packages> for the package name
2) Add the appropriate package to the package list in the `flake.nix` file

### Updating Nix `nixpkgs` Version

1) Modify the version of `inputs.nixpkgs.url` in the `flake.nix` file to the desired version, according to <https://status.nixos.org>
2) Run `./universal-build --update-nix-flake-lockfile` to update the `flake.lock` lockfile
3) Commit both files to version control

### Ensuring Gradle Files Are Up-To-Date

1) Run `./universal-build wrapper` to update the (this is just a pass-through to `./gradlew wrapper`)
   * This connects to the internet to reset the local self-contained Gradle files to the factory default of the given version. Note that this keeps the same Gradle version.
   * This can help if the Gradle files were stale or modified for some reason (for example, IntelliJ's starting Gradle template gives incorrect files in some cases)

### Upgrading Gradle Version

1) Run `./universal-build wrapper --gradle-version x.y`
   * This connects to the internet to reset the local self-contained Gradle files to the factory default of the given version.

## 5. Shutdown

Shutdown pattern (implemented in `Main`):

1. SIGTERM (or SIGINT/SIGHUP) fires the shutdown hook, which interrupts the main thread and waits up to `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS` seconds for main to finish. Keep that grace period below the platform's SIGTERM-to-SIGKILL timeout (ECS and Kubernetes default to 30s)
2. Main clears the interrupt, performs all resource cleanup in its own `finally` block, then releases the hook
3. The JVM exits after the hook thread returns. On a normal exit the hook returns at once. After a signal the process exits with 128 + the signal number (143 for SIGTERM) regardless of main's exit code

Work must respond to that interrupt:

* The interrupt aborts interruptible waits (sleep, queue and latch waits, `Future.get`, SDK retry backoff) by throwing an exception, which should propagate up to `Main`
* Classic `java.net` socket I/O, `synchronized` and `Lock.lock()` ignore the interrupt, so a call already in flight runs until it returns or times out; normal calls finish well within `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS`
* Never swallow `InterruptedException`: declare it, or call `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` and rethrow it wrapped
* Only `Main` calls `System.exit`; elsewhere throw so the exception reaches `Main`
* CPU-bound loops check `Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()` between iterations
* Work on other threads is not interrupted; main must stop it in its `finally` block

Correctness is guaranteed by idempotency: dying at any point (including SIGKILL, which bypasses hooks entirely) leaves the system in a consistent state. Graceful shutdown only improves efficiency - it is never required for correctness.

&nbsp;

## 6. Output

The template builds one output: an OCI/container image that runs on container runtimes through `Main` and on AWS Lambda through `LambdaHandler`. Both entry points share the execution and business logic. The `Dockerfile` has one `CMD` line per entry point; keep exactly one uncommented. The AWS integrations are examples; the template can also support other cloud providers.

| Runtime | `CMD` |
|---|---|
| Container, ECS task, Kubernetes, EC2 host (default) | `io.template.Main` |
| AWS Lambda | `com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.api.client.AWSLambda io.template.LambdaHandler::handleRequest` |

The image's entrypoint applies the Nix runtime environment, then runs `java -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0` on the jars in the distribution's `lib/`, followed by the `CMD`. The JDK and OS userland that run in production are the ones pinned by `flake.lock` and the `Dockerfile`, on every runtime.

### OCI / Container (`Main`)

* For a container, ECS task, EC2 host or command-line run

To keep only Lambda, remove:

* `src/main/java/io/template/Main.java` and its JaCoCo exclude in `build.gradle.kts`
* The Shutdown section above and `closeResources` in `composition/AWSClientsModule.java`, including its unused `Injector` import
* The `Main` `CMD` line in the `Dockerfile`, and uncomment the Lambda one

### AWS Lambda (`LambdaHandler`)

* Lambda runs the image's entrypoint and `CMD`, so `java` starts the Lambda runtime interface client (`AWSLambda`), which polls the Lambda Runtime API and calls `LambdaHandler::handleRequest` for each event
* The event JSON reaches `Executor` as its single input argument
* Deploy the image with the infrastructure tool of your choice, for example CDK's `lambda.DockerImageCode.fromImageAsset(".")` as the `code` of a `lambda.DockerImageFunction`
* Lambda does not patch the JDK or OS inside an image. Patches arrive when `flake.lock` or the `Dockerfile` base image moves and the image is rebuilt
* The Shutdown section does not apply: Lambda freezes and later discards the execution environment without signaling the process, so clients live for the environment's lifetime

To keep only OCI/container deployment, remove:

* `src/main/java/io/template/LambdaHandler.java` and its JaCoCo exclude in `build.gradle.kts`
* The `aws-lambda-java-core` and `aws-lambda-java-runtime-interface-client` dependencies
* The Lambda `CMD` line in the `Dockerfile`

After removing an entry point, update this Output section and regenerate the Gradle lockfile using the workflow above. Keep the shared environment, execution, Guice modules, and DynamoDB sample unless you also choose to remove that sample.
