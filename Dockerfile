# 1. OS packages, filesystem layout, and user creation
#     - Within reason, the versions of these apt dependencies do not matter
#     - Creates a non-root user for both required Nix compatibility, and for security best practices
#     - Creates the directory that will hold our software; it is owned by the non-root user

#
# 2. Nix installation
#     - The Nix version only matters in one aspect: it must be new enough to support new features
#     - Aside from that, version does not matter as it is declarative based on the lockfile and flake
#

RUN curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --no-daemon

ENV NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"

#
# 3. Snapshot the runtime environment from the flake
#     - We snapshot the runtime dev shell environment once at image build time, then reuse it at runtime without invoking Nix again
#     - This is for security reasons and for minimizing runtime complexity
#

COPY flake.nix flake.lock /custom-software/buildtime-workspace/

#
# 4. Application bits and entrypoint
#     - Copies the Gradle application distribution produced by installDist
#     - Creates an entrypoint runtime wrapper that:
#         - Applies the flake-defined runtime dev shell environment recorded at image build time
#         - Runs java on the distribution's lib/ jars, with the main class and its arguments taken from CMD
#     - Keep exactly one CMD uncommented: Main for container runtimes (ECS, Fargate, Kubernetes, a host), LambdaHandler for AWS Lambda
